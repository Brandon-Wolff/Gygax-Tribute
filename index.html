        <p> Gary Gygax (1938-2008) was an American game designer and author best known for co-creating the pioneering role-playing game <em>Dungeons & Dragons</em>. He is often described as the father of D&D. 
        </p>
        <p> In 1967, Gary founded the International Federation of Wargamers (IFW) with Bill Speer and Scott Duncan. The next year, he rented a hall in his town of Lake Geneva to hold the first official Lake Geneva Convention, or Gen Con for short. Gen Con is now one of the largest hobby-game gatherings in North America. While the 1968 gathering is technically the first "Official" Gen Con, Gary hosted a 20 person gathering of wargamers in his basement in 1967 that is considered to be "Gen Con 0."
        </p>
        <p>Early in 1970, Gary created <em>Chainmail</em>, a midieval miniature wargame, with Jeff Perren. It included a fantasy supplement, which pioneered many ideas that would later be used in <em>Dungeons & Dragons</em>. Using a modified version of the <em>Chainmail</em> rules, Gygax and Dave Arneson collaborated on what they called "The Fantasy Game," the roleplaying game that would become <em>Dungeons & Dragons</em>.</p>
